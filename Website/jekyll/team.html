<h3>Team management</h3>
<p>
The team was split into three subteams - <b>software, hardware, marketing</b>. Each subteam had a leader primarily as a point of contact as tasks were
assigned on a indiviudal basis rather than to the team as a whole. As seen above, most members had a main role and subrole/s. Due to the lockdown, we were unable to access the robot in person and therefore most of the team leaned towards software. Maks, our <b>project manager</b>, made sure that the team and the project was going smoothly, and served as the main point of contact for the course organisers.
</p>

<p>
The offline team communications took place through <b>Slack</b> on work spaces organized based on the departments.
Slack served as a tool for making all offline decisions through polls and other means, as well as a casual forum to discuss non-essential decisions.
</p>
<p>All online meetings took place on our private <b>Teams</b> channel, thanks to which a history and lengths of meetings could be kept in one place. 
We used Teams to organise and place new documents in a structured way in folders for us to access later on if needed.

We chose <b>Overleaf</b> to write our reports as it offered a number of advantages such as change tracking, in depth formatting options and built-in referencing functionality. 
</p>

<p>
<b>GitHub</b> was used to share and version our code-base. New features were developed in separate branches, and Harry, our software lead, oversaw any pull requests to main. <b>Trello</b> was used to assign and keep track of all the available sub tasks and progress every week in a agile sprint-like manner. This meant it was easy for us to see who was working on what tasks for communication purposes, and allowed us to easily keep a backlog of tasks to be completed.

These tools were chosen since all of the members have used them in the past and were familiar with them.
</p>
<h3>Testing</h3>
<p>Continous Integration was integrated with out github repository and unit and integration tests were written in order to make sure every component and subsystem was reliable, 
	and that each subsequent pull request did not cause any regressions.
</p>
<h3>Meetings</h3>

<p>Every week on Friday at 2pm the team held full team meetings with our mentor where progress was be evaluated against the master plan, 
	and the plan adjusted if need be, in general discussing difficulties and issues with the project.
	Other meetings were be organised on an as-needed-basis.</p>
