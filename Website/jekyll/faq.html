               <h3><b>Data protection policy</b></h3>
               <p>The video feeds captured by the vision subsystem for identifying door and door handles are processed in real-time locally on Dr. Phil and are deleted immediately after processing.</p>

               <h3><b>How secure is firebase/login setup?</b></h3>
                <p>Our database uses server-side encryption under the 256-bit Advanced Encryption Standard, and each encryption key is itself encrypted with a regularly rotated set of master keys.</p>

                <p>Our database read/write rules were configured to maximise security in order to prevent any malicious users from attempting to control robots by manipulating user data in the database. This was done by only allowing users to access data that they own (ensuring their user ID matches that stored in the document). Since every user has a unique user ID that is set and stored by the Firestore API adapting this user ID for a database read/write request to access other users' data would be infeasible.</p>
                
               <h3><b>What disinfectant solution should Dr.Phil use?</b></h3>
               <p>As stated in the user guide, 70% alcohol is best. This is because alternatives such as hydrogen peroxide are dangerous to humans, and higher concentratiosn of alcohol actually lead to lower disinfection rates as it evaporates too quickly.</p>
