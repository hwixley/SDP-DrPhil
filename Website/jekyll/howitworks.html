                    Uses a Raspberry Pi camera x algorithm to detect door handles

                    <h3>SLAM</h3>
                    route planning using x algorithm to build a map of its environment and travel within it.

                    <h3>Raspberry pi</h3>
                    Main processor, handles communications between the various sensors and the app.
                    Can handle the vision algorithm
