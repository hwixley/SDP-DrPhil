                    <p>Dr. Phil consists of 4 interconnected sections:
                        <ul class="beginInd">
                            <li><a href="#navigation">A navigation stack </a> which maps the environment and moves the robot to it's objectives.</li>
                            <li><a href="#disinfection">A disinfecting stack </a> that pumps disinfectant to a nozzle located at the top of the arm.</li>
                            <li><a href="#armcontrol">An arm movement stack </a>that can grip doors as well as move for maximum spray coverage.</li>

                        </ul>

                    <h2 id="disinfection">Disinfection</h2>
                        <p>The disinfection stack is primarily hardware based. We have a pump which pumps water from the base of the turtlebot  to the nozzle located at the top of the arm. This is necessary because the disinfectant storage solution is heavy and would unbalance the arm. </p>

                        <i><h4>The Nozzle</h4></i>
                        <p>To spray the disinfectant onto contact points, we decided to use a full-cone nozzle, which evenly distributes the disinfectant inside it's spray cone. This is important to ensure the spray will cover contact points efficently and accurately.</p>

                        <i><h4>Control</h4></i>
                        <p>Dr. Phil controls the pump via the 12V openCR board which comes with the turtlebot. </p>

                    <h3>Machine vision</h3>
                    Uses a Raspberry Pi camera x algorithm to detect door handles

                    <h3>SLAM</h3>
                    route planning using x algorithm to build a map of its environment and travel within it.

                    <h3>Raspberry pi</h3>
                    Main processor, handles communications between the various sensors and the app.
                    Can handle the vision algorithm
                    <h3>Ios app</h3>
                    We've created an IOS app which allows users to select the time for the robot to start/stop cleaning.
