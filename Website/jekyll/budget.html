						<p>Links in the table below takes you to a site where the part can be purchased, or a .zip for 3D printing (check user guide for instructions). This is part of our ethos that Dr. Phil parts should be easily replaceable and serviceable.  </p>

						  <p>Our current prototype is only suitable for interacting with our custom short 50cm doors, as the arm is only has a max reach of 30cm and isn't long enough to reach normal door handles which are 1 metre high. For production, we will have to increase the reach of the arm. 
						  </p>
							  
							 <p>
							  The <a href="https://www.trossenrobotics.com/widowx-250-mobile-robot-arm-6dof.aspx">WidowX 250 robotic arm</a> has more than double the reach of the pincher x100, and being made by the same company means it should be easily integrated to our existing system. Furthermore, one of our major issues with door opening was the low degrees of freedom (number of rotateable parts) of the pincher x100. The WidowX has 2 more (6 compared to 4), which should make arm movement planning easier. We can make up the rest of the height with a 3D printed base which'll attach to the turtlebot. </p>
							<p>The turtlebot's original battery only has an estimated battery life of ~30 minutes of continous operation. We propose to change the battery to a <a href="https://www.componentshop.co.uk/batteries/batteries-radio-control/batteries-radio-control-li-po-flight-packs/batteries-radio-control-li-po-flight-packs-111v-3s-packs.html">4500mAH one</a>, which is easily doable as the turtlebot has a standard Lithium polymer battery connection, and should more than double battery life of Dr. Phil.</p>
							<p>The production model will also use the Raspberry Pi 4B instead of the Raspberry Pi 3B installed on the turtlebot. This is primarily because we anticipate major memory issues on the Raspberry Pi 3B which only has 2GB of ram. The Raspberry Pi 4B has 8GB which will alleviate this issue. </p>

						</div>	

						<p>We've also looked at breaking down turtlebot prices. As shown in this <a href="./images/Bulk Purchase.xlsx"/>spreadsheet</a>, the turtlebot's parts are only ~£950 individually, so assembling the parts ourselves/ordering custom parts will lower the expected total cost to <b>£3254</b> This would only be possible if we receive a large number of orders and get the components in bulk, and assembly might be too complicated for a variety of reasons.</p>

						<p>In either case, we propose to sell it to the public for £4000, which is still 5-10x cheaper than the UV robots currently available, making us extremely competitive in the disinfecting robot market.</p>
