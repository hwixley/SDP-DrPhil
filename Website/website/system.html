                <h3>Concept</h3>
DRPHIL is a robot designed to automatically navigate through and sanitise points of contact in buildings.


 It is able to navigate rooms by itself and open doors to get to the next location. 

<h1>Market research</h1>
The products, not just in the disinfecting robot market, are still solutions for the same problem, hence we must consider them as an indirect competitor, these include the StepNPull door pedal, Purehold door handle, and others. These products can only be used for one door, hence in a large commercial building with over 50 doors, these solutions become extremely expensive when they cost around £30 per door (\hyperlink{stepnpull}{StepNpull, n.d.}; \hyperlink{purehold}{Purehold Ltd, n.d.}). 

Companies that are developing and selling disinfectant robots will be our primary competition. From the initial market research, it is clear that the landscape of the market is not yet set. There are many big companies all building disinfectant robots, however, each robot is very specific to its task. A fully autonomous mobile disinfectant robot is yet to be seen. 

What our product seeks to improve from its direct competitors is to provide a safer, more versatile, and cheaper solution to commercial sanitisation. The most significant problem with these UV rollers is that they use high-intensity rays to kill viruses, which can be very damaging to humans at this intensity (\hyperlink{fda}{FDA, 08/19/2020}). This not only adds a further safety hazard but also limits when and where this robot can be used. Furthermore, these UV rollers are unable to navigate buildings alone as they are unable to open doors, our product aims to solve this. Finally, we seek to provide a more affordable commercial solution given these UV rollers cost upwards of £50000. % I couldn't find a price for these - there was only one from a rather sketch site - https://www.servicerobots.com/uv-cleaning-robots/ listed at £24000

In relation to janitors, they themselves are possible transmission vectors, cost on average £20000 per year \hyperlink{glassdoor}{(Glassdoor, n.d)}, and have limited working hours. Our product is an opportunity for companies to add automation to their sanitisation protocols. As a result, this will cut costs and the disinfectant routines would be more efficient.


<h1>Potential for future development</h1>

Further navigation capabilities"As  a  customer,  I  want  the  robot  to  be  able  toaccess other floors as well."Solution: The agent will be able to use elevators to goto different floors of a building.–Hardware1.  Configure grippers to use elevator buttons–Software1.Use ML image recognition to recognise a liftand it’s keypad2.Create a robot arm manipulation algorithmthat can interact with the elevator keypad3.  Be able to enter and exit the elevator door•Further sanitisation support"As a customer, we would like it if we can sanitisedifferent door handles and touch points around it."Solution:  The agent will be able to recognise andadapt to more types of door handles and touch pointsnear it for sanitisation.–Software1.Create an algorithm that can model many dif-ferent types of door handles and touch pointsaccurately•Further door opening support"As  a  customer,   we  would  like  it  if  the  robothas  no  problems  to  open  all  types  of  doors  withdifferent handles"Solution:  The agent will be able to recognise andadapt to more types of door handles for opening.–Hardware1.Fit it with suitable equipment so that it canopen locks/keypads–Software1.Create a ML door handle recognition modelthat can cater for many different types of doorhandle accurately2.Adapt to doors of varying weights and orien-tations
Group Number: 13Project Plan•COVID patrol features"As   a   customer   buying   this   product,   it   wouldbe  useful  during  the  pandemic  if  the  robot  couldmonitor people’s distances in order for us to feel saferin our workspace."Solution: The agent will be able to detect how manypeople in the building were wearing masks,  socialdistancing, and what temperatures they had.–Software1.Use ML image recognition to detect if peopleare wearing masks and/or social distancing2.Store all statistics appropriately for easy in-terpretation from the user client
